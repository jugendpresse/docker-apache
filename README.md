# Apache Base Image
## Provisioned by @jugendpresse

Docker images provided within this repository are built on the needs of @jugendpresse.

Base-usage is to provide a as far as possible customizable Apache Webserver for (almost) every PHP-Application.

Within this Repository you only find the Dockerfile and the pipeline configuration to build the image.

## How to get this container run

## Environmental Variables

This image is customizable by these environmental variables:

| **YESWWW**            | false                 | yes                | Duplicate content has to be avoided – therefore a decision for containers delivering content of `www.domain.tld` and `domain.tld` has to be made which one should be the mainly used one. **YESWWW** will be overridden by **NOWWW** if both are true. |

## Files and directories to be aware of

### `/boot.d/` – direcotry for additional scripts on bootup

If you want to do the container sth on bootup, this folder is the location to place your `*.sh`-files.

### `/templates/apache.j2` – the Apache Config

The apache config used within containers of this image. It will be provisioned at every start of the container – so you should consider to mount a new template instead of mounting a default apache config directly.

<details>
 <summary>Full Template</summary>

```
</details>

### Default cron entries

By default the `CRON_PATH` variable directs to `/etc/cron.d/docker`. *You should mount that file from your host data or a volume.*  
If you mount an empty file for the beginning, that would be fine since if the file is empty at boot, the following default content with comments and description of the cron file will be provided into it:

```sh
# This crontab file holds commands for all users to be run by
# cron. Each command is to be defined within a separate line.
#
# To define the time you can provide concrete (numeric) values,
# comma separate them or use `*` to use any of the possible
# values.
# You can also use basic calculation - i.e. if you want to run
# a job every 20th minute use `*/20`.
#
# The tasks will be started based on the system time and
# timezone.
#
#
# The example below would print a message to the STDOUT of the
# docker container and - if any error does occur – the errors
# will be printed to the STDERR of the container.
#
# Please be aware that you are locating the crontab file within
# `/etc/cron.d` directory and for that there is also the need
# to define the user who should run the cron command!
#
# ┌────────────────────────────────── minute (0-59)
# │    ┌───────────────────────────── hour (0-23)
# │    │    ┌──────────────────────── day (1-31)
# │    │    │    ┌─────────────────── month (1-12)
# │    │    │    │    ┌────────────── day of week (0-6, sunday equals 0)
# │    │    │    │    │    ┌───────── user
# │    │    │    │    │    │    ┌──── command
# │    │    │    │    │    │    │
# ┴    ┴    ┴    ┴    ┴    ┴    ┴
# */20 *    *    *    *    root echo 'this is a demonstration cronjob'  1> /proc/1/fd/1  2> /proc/1/fd/2
```
